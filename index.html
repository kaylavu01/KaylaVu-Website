        <div class="subheading mb-5">Psychology MajorðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Kayla Vu. Currently, I am a third year student at University of California, Riverside majoring in Psychology. After I graduate, I intend to apply to a nursing school or get my radiology technician degree in the next couple of years. I plan on graduating my 4th or 5th year since I changed my majored during my third year. I was a Biology Major in CNAS, but quickly realized that pathway was not meant for me at all.<br><br>

        I am a first generation student in my family. I have two younger brothers, Anthony is in his 2nd year of college at Mt. Sac and would be transferring to either Cal Poly or Fullerton. My youngest brother, Denny is a freshmen in South Hills High School. We are a Vietnamese family with a 2 year old chunky German Shepherd named Rocky. Current hobbies that I enjoy doing is hiking weekly with my friend. We currently hike around Riverside. Hiking up to the C is our current goal before we graduate. My grandparents loves hiking, and for their age, they are far superior compared to other seniors. We hiked the Grand Canyon trails, and most places in Seattle like Mount Rainier. They hiked many places in Vietnam, Thailand, and many more states and countries that theyâ€™ve traveled too. My goal for this year is to take my grandparents to Yosemite and one of their best hiking trails. Currently, I do not have any professional experiences. I did take 2 years of sports medicine during my high school years and gained a lot of first hand emergencies. I am CPR certified which is helpful for the future. During my two years in sports medicine, I witnessed a lot accidents. For example, a girl torn her ACL from landing on the wrong angle during a volleyball game. I helped with her recovery from start to end. There was another torn ACL during a football practice that I also helped with recovery. It is pretty cool to see how sports medicine plays a huge role in an athletes recovery. Credits to my teacher, Dr. L and a sports medicine physician, Carlos who transferred to UCLA for better opportunities. If it wasnâ€™t for Dr. L and Carlos, I wouldnâ€™t be as passionate in the sports medicine field, but thanks to them, they made me realized how important therapy is for a speedy recovery with our injuries.<br><br>

        I want to work in the medical field once I graduate college. My grandma and Aunt plays a huge role since they were nurses back in their days. My aunt left her nursing job to open up her own nail salon since she finds that nursing is not something she wants to spend the rest of her lifetime doing. My grandma gave up nursing to help raise my aunt and dad back in Vietnam, but she loved her nursing career. I grew up with my grandparents and still remembers all of my grandmaâ€™s nursing stories that she would tell there and then.
